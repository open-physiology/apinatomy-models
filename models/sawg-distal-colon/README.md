# SAWG ApiNATOMY model of the descending colon

This digital record documents the ApiNATOMY representation of the distal colon.In particular, this model illustrates predominantly feline model of the sympathetic and visceral sensing of a prototypical segment of distal colonic muscle layers, blood supply, Peyer’s patches and enteroendocrine cells. This model encodes over fifteen neuron types, the proximal of which invest the colon from the thoracolumbar spinal cord, while the distal neurons typify the functional circuitry of the enteric nervous system. 

ApiNATOMY is a set of tools that produces simple, consistent anatomy schematics overlaid with ontological information. These tools are used to build routing and connectivity graphs (or wiring diagrams). This record contains a docs folder and a README text file. The Docs folder contains a PDF document, with a schematic image of the ApiNATOMY model. The Source folder contains the ApiNATOMY representation of the model in JSON and .xlsx formats. Lastly, the README .md document includes a brief description, keywords, and reference publications to construct the knowledge within the model
